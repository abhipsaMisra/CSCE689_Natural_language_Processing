Compile and Run:
The source code is placed in the 2 files: NaiveBayes.py and Perceptron.py
The files are placed in the src folder, and the data is placed in the data folder.

Task1: - NaiveBayes classifier training
Script: ~\PA2\src\NaiveBayes.py
Script parameters:  ../data/imdb1
Working directory: ~\PA2

It can be executed through command line as:
a.	Navigate to the directory which has the code and dev data
b.	Run: 
Python NaiveBayes.py ../data/imdb1

Task 2: - NaiveBayes with stop words removed
Script: ~\PA2\src\NaiveBayes.py
Script parameters:  -f ../data/imdb1
Working directory: ~\PA2

It can be executed through command line as:
c.	Navigate to the directory which has the code and dev data
d.	Run: 
Python NaiveBayes.py -f ../data/imdb1

Task 3: - Binarized NaïveBayes
Script: ~\PA2\src\NaiveBayes.py
Script parameters:  -b ../data/imdb1
Working directory: ~\PA2

It can be executed through command line as:
e.	Navigate to the directory which has the code and dev data
f.	Run: 
Python NaiveBayes.py -b ../data/imdb1


Task 4: - Perceptron Classifier
Script: ~\PA2\src\Perceptron.py
Script parameters: -../data/imdb1 50
Working directory: ~\PA2

It can be executed through command line as:
g.	Navigate to the directory which has the code and dev data
h.	Run: 
Python Perceptron.py ../data/imdb1 50
